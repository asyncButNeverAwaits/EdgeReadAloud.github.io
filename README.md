### Warning
Personal project. Use at your own risk, feature might break in future.

# Why
- Open a large-size text file (e.g. book) in Microsoft Edge and listening with Read Aloud is laggy.
- Finding out where I last left off is troublesome.

# Feature
- Save text file in browser IndexedDB
- Save read progress to github repository
- Autosave when Read Aloud stop reading
- Personalisation settings (theme, font size, scroll position)
- Save settings to github repository
- PWA, able to add as shortcut to your mobile

# Configuration
## Repository path
Create a new repository for progress and setting storage.

Paste your repository path, for example:

input `EdgeReadAloud/progress` for repository `https://github.com/EdgeReadAloud/progress`

Create `progress.json` and `setting.json` in the repository.
